  Hi There! My name is Arnold. ðŸ‘‹ 

  I'm a Web-Developer working out of the UK. I used to be in law enforcement and for the past 6 months have dedicated my full attention to code.

  I've completed a coding bootcamp with Le Wagon https://www.lewagon.com/, during which time I created TripSelector in a team of 4. This is available here:   https://github.com/AJCJ1/tripselector
